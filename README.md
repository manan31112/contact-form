It is designed for developers who want a **lightweight, maintainable contact form** for personal websites, portfolios, or small projects.

## Features

- Responsive, accessible UI with **Tailwind CSS**
- **Real-time validation** and inline error messages

- **EmailJS integration** (no backend required)
- Environment variable support for secure configuration

## Configuration

2. Create an **Email Service** and **Email Template**  
3. Retrieve the following values from your EmailJS dashboard:
